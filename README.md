# PhaseGeometry Resonance Programme — Operational Phase Framework for Devices

This repository hosts the LaTeX sources and supporting material for the
**PhaseGeometry Resonance** programme: an operational, phase-based language
for superconducting and quantum devices within standard 3+1D superconductivity
and electromagnetism.

The aim is not to modify the Standard Model or GR, but to provide a compact
phase-language for known physics and for designing concrete, testable devices
(phase rotators, resonant field cells, thick SNS weak links and related circuits).

## Programme focus

The Resonance line currently covers:

- a standing-wave / resonant-field picture of Meissner screening and
  Josephson barriers;
- phase rotators and thick SNS weak links as controllable phase elements;
- resonant field cells and phase coils as building blocks for phase-based circuits;
- a growing **phase-device zoo** connecting quantum and semiclassical devices
  in a common phase description;
- bridge notes on phase clocks and weak gravitational fields
  (Phase Geometry Series Parts II–III), which connect Resonance to
  the 5D PhaseFibre line;
- a standalone experimental proposal **“Magnetic Phase Control of a Thick SNS Weak Link”**,
  treating a thick SNS bridge with an on-chip microcoil as a loopless, locally
  addressable phase element.

A compiled PDF collection of the original **Phase Geometry Series:
Superconductivity and Weak Gravity (Parts I–III and Overview)** is archived
on Zenodo under DOI `10.5281/zenodo.17807163`.

## Repository layout

(Current layout — may evolve as new versions are added.)

- `V_2.2/` — LaTeX sources and PDFs for the Phase Geometry Series v2.2:
  overview, manifesto, Parts I–III and related notes on superconductivity
  and weak gravity.
- `devices/` — standalone device papers and notes, currently including
  **“Magnetic Phase Control of a Thick SNS Weak Link: Proposed experimental scheme”**
  and future Resonance device designs.

Folders and filenames may be refined as the programme grows, but existing PDFs/TeX
can be moved without changing their scientific content.

## Relation to other PhaseGeometry series

Other parts of the PhaseGeometry programme live in separate repositories:

- **PhaseGeometry-Z2** — minimal binary (+/–) phase medium, dark energy and halos.  
- **PhaseGeometry-5D-PhaseFibre** — phase as a compact extra dimension and
  a weak-field phase-based framework linking gravity and electromagnetism.

The Resonance programme concentrates on **devices and experiments** built on
standard SC/EM physics, while Z₂ and PhaseFibre cover more field-theoretic
and geometric aspects.
