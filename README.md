# PhaseGeometry Resonance Programme — Operational Phase Framework for Devices

This repository hosts the LaTeX sources and supporting material for the
**PhaseGeometry Resonance** programme: an operational, phase-based language
for superconducting and quantum devices within standard 3+1D superconductivity
and electromagnetism.

The aim is not to modify the Standard Model or GR, but to provide a compact
phase-language for known physics and for designing concrete, testable devices
(phase rotators, resonant field cells, phase coils and related circuits).

## Programme focus

The Resonance line currently covers:

- a standing-wave / resonant-field picture of Meissner screening and
  Josephson barriers;
- phase rotators and thick SNS weak links as controllable phase elements;
- resonant field cells and phase coils as building blocks for phase-based circuits;
- a growing **phase-device zoo** connecting quantum and semiclassical devices
  in a common phase description;
- bridge notes on phase clocks and weak gravitational fields
  (Phase Geometry Series Parts II–III), which connect Resonance to
  the 5D PhaseFibre line.

A compiled PDF collection of the original **Phase Geometry Series:
Superconductivity and Weak Gravity (Parts I–III and Overview)** is archived
on Zenodo under DOI `10.5281/zenodo.17807163`.

## Repository layout

(Initial layout — may evolve as new versions are added.)

- `docs/` — main Resonance notes:
  programme overview / manifesto, Parts I and I-B, bridge notes, technical
  supplements.
- `device_zoo/` — tables and notes for the Phase-Device Zoo
  (classification, parameters, experimental status).
- `figures/` — shared figures and plots used across the Resonance texts.
- `archive/` — older versions and legacy drafts, if needed.

Folders may be introduced gradually as material is added; existing PDFs/TeX
can be moved into this layout without changing their scientific content.

## Relation to other PhaseGeometry series

Other parts of the PhaseGeometry programme live in separate repositories:

- **PhaseGeometry-Z2** — minimal binary (+/–) phase medium, dark energy and halos.  
- **PhaseGeometry-Manifold** — continuous phase manifolds and Möbius-like
  internal geometry.  
- **PhaseGeometry-5D-PhaseFibre** — phase as a compact extra dimension and
  a weak-field phase-based framework linking gravity and electromagnetism.

The Resonance programme concentrates on **devices and experiments** built on
standard SC/EM physics, while Z₂, Manifold and PhaseFibre cover more
field-theoretic and geometric aspects.
